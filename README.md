# SwIL_SSM
Included are files to run an in silico site saturation mutagenesis (SSM) screening. The per_position_sampling.xml script is executed with the RosettaScript framework. The submitter.sh SLURM file can be used to submit the xml script to a HPC cluster. A pdb file of the SwIL15 variant is included to test the scripts.
